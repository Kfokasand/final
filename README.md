BA3 SV informatics project

Simulations can be ran Custom (selecting parameters) or Automatic

Simulations steps are alway 0.1 ms long

NB: programmed external stimulation (Iext) is switched off by default, methods using it have only been kept for testing purposes

Automatic: Simulation runs with 

12 000 neurons
1000 excitatory with a weight of 0.1
250 inhibitory with a weight of -0.5

Each neuron has 1000 excitatory and 250 inhibitory incoming connections.
Simulation time : 1000 ms (10 000 steps)

The user can choose recording boudaries in ms


Custom: The user can select the parameters

total number of neurons
number of excitatory
number of inhibitory

number of incoming excitatory connections and their weight
number of incoming inhibitory connections and their weight

Time of simulation

Recording boudaries

Neuron parameters are :
(these cannot be changed)
